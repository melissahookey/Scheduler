  ## Description
  A simple work-day schedule application that updates in real time. Users can add their tasks and cross them off as they complete them!

  ## Project Requirements
    GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
    WHEN I open the planner
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
    WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
    THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    WHEN I click into a timeblock
    THEN I can enter an event
    WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
    WHEN I refresh the page
    THEN the saved events persist
