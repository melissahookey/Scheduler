  ## Description
  A simple work-day schedule application that updates in real time. Users can add their tasks and cross them off as they complete them!


  ## Project Requirements
  GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
  WHEN I open the planner
  THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
  WHEN I scroll down
  THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
  WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
  THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
  WHEN I click into a timeblock
  THEN I can enter an event
  WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
  THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
  WHEN I refresh the page
  THEN the saved events persist
